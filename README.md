# Simple Terrain Generator Using OpenGL

## 📝 Overview
This is my OpenGL learning project - an procedural terrain generator that creates realistic 3D landscapes using noise algorithms. While it has limited features, it's been a fun way to explore:
- OpenGL rendering pipeline
- GLSL shaders
- Procedural generation techniques
- Camera systems
- Basic terrain texturing

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- Written in C++17
- Uses modern OpenGL (core profile)
- GLFW for window/input management
- GLAD for OpenGL loading
- GLM for math operations
- Custom noise generation algorithms

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Visual Studio 2022
- OpenGL 4.6 compatible GPU
- GLFW3
- GLM
